# About project
You can register account and then log in. Since you've logged in, if there are another accounts registered, you can search them and add them to your conversations. Anytime you add a new conversation you should re-log (log in and out) to work correctly, because there is no refresh token implemented that would make it work instantly. If you don't do that you might have problems with video-calling or sending messages
